<b>Memory Implants - Rimworld mod</b>

Adds a new research project called "Memory Implants" that unlocks the Memory Assistant implant.

The implant will lower the skill loss to 20% of the original value. Together with Great Memory trait it will be just 10%.

The drawback of the implant is that it lowers learning by 20% and the pawn will experience brain shock upon receiving EMP damage.
